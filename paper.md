# Summary

Ever wonder if a GPU or Xeon Phi accelerator card would make your code faster?
Fast enough to justify the expense to your manager, adviser, or funding agency?
[HiPerC](https://hiperc.readthedocs.io) can help answer your questions! By
implementing the same system of partial differential equations using several
competing parallelization platforms for CPU and GPU, it clearly illustrates
the tradeoff between coding complexity and runtime performance. The bottom
line is that accelerators, especially graphics cards, will improve performance
of workloads typical of computational materials science.
