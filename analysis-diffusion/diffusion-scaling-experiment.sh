# This script will build and execute diffusion programs for CPU and GPU architectures
# on a square mesh with edge length L=256 units, using the following set of mesh
# resolutions: 256, 512, 768, 1024, 1280, 1536, 1792, & 2048 points per dimension.
# The results are stored in the separate program directories, moved from `runlog.csv`
# to `runlog_<edge>.csv. These are then used by plot_runtimes.py to create scaling
# plots of runtime as a function of domain size (LÃ—L) for each successful simulation.
