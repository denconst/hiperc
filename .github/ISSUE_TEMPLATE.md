Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions.
You can start a discussion on [gitter](https://gitter.im/usnistgov/hiperc) for that.

### When reporting a bug, please be sure to include the following:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] A minimal example to reproduce the behavior (*e.g.* GitHub gist focused on the failing code)
- [ ] What platform(s) you're running `hiperc` on
- [ ] What packages or other dependencies you're using
- [ ] The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

### When you open an issue for a feature request, please add as much detail as possible:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] An explanation of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* it is a problem
- [ ] An overview of the suggested solution
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better
